# Predicting Consumer Tastes with Big Data at Gap

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis related to the team project on **Predicting Consumer Tastes with Big Data at Gap**, based on the **Harvard Business School Case Study (517115-PDF-ENG)**. The goal of this project is to assess the role of big data in informing business decisions at Gap Inc., particularly in light of the company’s move away from traditional creative direction towards a data-driven process.

Gap’s CEO, Art Peck, sought to replace creative directors with big data-driven processes to predict consumer trends and streamline product development. This project explores whether this decision was the right move, how big data can be applied across different Gap brands, and the balance between data analytics and creative intuition in marketing strategy.

## Project Objectives

The repository aims to answer the following questions through the provided analysis and code:

1. **Was Art Peck correct in firing his creative directors?**
    - We analyze whether transitioning from relying on the creative vision of directors to a big data-driven approach was a strategic decision. This includes evaluating how data informs creative decisions versus the traditional role of directors in fashion brands.

2. **What types of web data can support Gap's data-driven creative process?**
    - We collect and demonstrate how web data (from sources like social media, customer reviews, Google Trends, and competitor analyses) can provide insights into consumer tastes and preferences. The analysis highlights how this data can inform product development, trend forecasting, and decision-making at Gap.

3. **Is the big data approach effective for Gap Inc.'s primary brands: Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic?**
    - The repository includes analysis for each of the three brands, determining which ones benefit more from the data-driven strategy. The data is sourced from non-brand sites, such as fashion blogs, customer sentiment data, and industry reports, to illustrate brand-specific insights.

4. **For what purposes are big data and predictive analytics more or less useful in marketing?**
    - This analysis focuses on the balance between "art" (creative intuition) and "science" (data analytics) in marketing. We assess how and when Gap should lean on data versus traditional creative instincts in its marketing strategy.

5. **How can the marketing team balance art vs. science using web data?**
    - Recommendations are made on how Gap's marketing team can leverage the insights from big data while maintaining the creative aspects of fashion marketing, ensuring the right balance between art and science in their decision-making processes.
